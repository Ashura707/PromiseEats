# PromiseEats

PromiseEats is a clone of the popular food delivery platform, Zomato. This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript promises to manage asynchronous operations, such as checking order status, handling restaurant acceptance, and assigning delivery agents.

## Features

- **Add/Remove Items to/from Cart**
- **Checkout and Payment**
- **Order Tracking**
  - Real-time restaurant acceptance/rejection.
  - Automated order preparation and valet assignment.
  - Estimated delivery time updates.
- **Interactive UI**
  - User-friendly prompts and alerts to simulate the order process.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: JavaScript (Promises)
- **Version Control**: Git
